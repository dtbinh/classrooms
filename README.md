# Classrooms
This is a webapp that shows currently unoccupied classrooms in a building in the University of Waterloo.
The unoccupied classrooms are determined from which classrooms currently do not have a class scheduled in them.

Take a look [here](http://www.jkliu.ca/classrooms).

Built with AngularJS, UI Bootstrap, and Python.
